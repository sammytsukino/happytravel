## About the Project

**happytravel¬Æ** is a fictional alternative travel agency that flips the conventional travel industry on its head. Instead of promising sun-soaked beaches and picture-perfect moments, we specialize in curated melancholic experiences, embracing the beauty in gloom, solitude, and reflection.

> *"We specialize in journeys to places where time stands still and emotions run deep."*

## Concept

In a world oversaturated with "instagrammable" vacation spots and artificially cheerful tourism, happytravel¬Æ offers an authentic alternative ‚Äì destinations and experiences that invoke deeper emotional responses, introspection, and genuine connection with places that tell stories of time, decay, and quiet beauty.

Our design aesthetic reflects this concept through:

- Grayscale imagery
- Blue-to-black gradient color scheme
- Playful contradiction between the "happy" brand name and melancholic offerings
- Brutalist design elements with cycling logo animations
- Mix of serif and sans-serif typography
